Markov the Twitters by Mia Cooledge

Markov the Twitters is a Twitter-searching Markov generator. It uses your search
term to find tweets, which it then Markovs together into new tweets.

To run:

1. Download and install Twython from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twython
2. Create a twitter app at apps.twitter.com > "Create New App"
3. Make a file titled config.py in the same folder as MarkovTheTwitters.py.
    Copy and paste the following text:
        OAUTH_KEY = "<YOUR_KEY>"
        OAUTH_SECRET = "<YOUR_SECRET>"
    Insert your key and secret between the quotes.
    Example.config.py can also be edited and renamed for this step.

You should now be ready to run the MarkovTheTwitters file.
If you continue to get a key and secret error, double check that your key and
secret are accurate.
